Games like Abadox: the deadly inner war do not have info collected correclty because their link is not the same as their game title name (in this case the page name is "abadox") The picture description and genres are all "n/a"


The Adams family games are not contained like the other games
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Addams_Family:_Pugsley's_Scavenger_Hunt
Their descriptions will be incorect, and I dont know how to fix them right now

broken pages:
265 guerrilla warfare		wrong wiki page searched	Ill fix it later

check for empty genre set to detect wrong wiki page searched errors, these items will incorect pictures, links, and descriptions, but may have correct names and dates
